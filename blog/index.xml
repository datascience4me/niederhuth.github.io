      <description>Epigenetics is confusing. It’s one of those scientific concepts, like quantum mechanics or &amp;ldquo;survival of the fittest&amp;rdquo;, that are often misunderstood and misapplied. How widespread this confusion is, is made evident by the publication of entire papers dedicated just to clarifying the term [1]. This is problematic not only scientifically, but also socially, as “epigenetics” is now even being used in marketing; typically to push the latest health scam. Hopefully this post can shed a little light on just what epigenetics is.</description>
