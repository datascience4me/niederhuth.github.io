      <description>The lab is now officially started at MSU. The future lab space and office is currently still undergoing remodeling and at the moment I am working out of Dr. Doug Schemske&amp;rsquo;s former lab space. Lot of history here and I am happy to have joined a wonderful group of colleagues and a vibrant plant biology community.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that the Niederhuth Lab will be starting at Michigan State University in the Department of Plant Biology on January 1, 2018. Our research focuses on plant genomics and epigenomics using both experimental and computational approaches. If you are interested in joining the lab, please check our current openings!
